## Getting Monogame to work on OSX

1) Install Microsoft .NET for Mac using the x64 (and ARM installers for Apple Sillicon)(https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
2) Setup VSCode using this installation guide. Make sure to install the optional MonoGame extension (https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/2_choosing_your_ide_vscode.html?tabs=macos)
3) Install Homebrew (MacOS package manager) using this website: (https://brew.sh/)
4) Install the necessary libraries using the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install freeimage freetype libpng
    ```

5) Fix a dependency by linking libfreetype's install directory to the one checked by Monogame using the command

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib /usr/local/lib/freetype6
    ```
# BattleshipGame.cs
## `Initialize` 

The `Initialize` method sets up the game environment for Battleship by configuring graphics, initializing game objects, and establishing event handlers.

## Purpose

- Configure the game window size and title.
- Initialize player grids, ship manager, and turn manager.
- Set up event handling for ship placement and turn management.

## `LoadContent`

The `LoadContent` method is responsible for loading game assets and initializing game components for both the main menu and the gameplay phase of the Battleship game.

## Purpose

- Load fonts and content for the main menu and ship selection if the game has not started.
- Initialize game objects and event handlers when the game is in progress.

## `Update`

The `Update` method manages game state transitions, updates game objects, handles player input, and controls game logic in the Battleship game.

## Purpose

- To handle input for exiting the game and transitioning between menus and gameplay.
- To update game objects based on the current game state.
- To manage ship placements and shooting logic for players.

## Functionality

### Exit Conditions

- Exits the game if the back button or the escape key is pressed.

### Menu Updates (When Not in Game)

1. **Main Menu**:
   - Updates the main menu.
   - Transitions to ship selection or settings based on user selection.
   - Exits the game if "Exit" is selected.

2. **Ship Selection Menu**:
   - Updates the ship selection menu.
   - Transitions to gameplay if "Start Game" is clicked.
   - Returns to the main menu if the back button is clicked.

3. **Settings Menu**:
   - Updates settings and applies selected difficulty.
   - Returns to the main menu if the back button is clicked.

### Gameplay Updates (When in Game)

- Resets to the main menu if no ships are selected.
- Updates player grids and cursor based on current tile selections.

### Player Input Handling

- If AI is disabled:
  - Updates cursor for ship placement or shooting.
  - Checks for mouse button releases to acknowledge clicks.
  - Manages turn swapping and updates ship manager based on current actions.

- If AI is enabled:
  - Randomly selects grid positions for AI placements.
  - Handles cursor updates and clicking logic similarly to the player.

## `Draw`

The `Draw` method is responsible for rendering all visual elements of the Battleship game, updating the screen in a continuous loop based on the current game state.

## Purpose

- To draw the main menu, ship selection menu, settings, and game elements based on whether the game is in progress.

## `HandleShooting`

The `HandleShooting` method manages player and AI shooting logic in the Battleship game. It determines the actions to take based on the current game state and selected difficulty level.

## Purpose

- To handle shooting mechanics for both the player and the AI, updating game states and conditions accordingly.

## Functionality

### Player Shooting (When Difficulty is Disabled)

- **Perform Shooting**:
  - Depending on whose turn it is, calls the `Shoot()` method on the respective player's grid.
  - Decrements the hit limit for the opponent if the shot is successful.
- **Turn Management**: Switch turns and hides the ships of the player who is not currently taking their turn.
- **Game End Check**: If either player's hit limit reaches zero, the game ends, and the state is reset to the main menu.

### Easy Difficulty

- **AI Shooting Logic**: If it's the AI's turn, it randomly selects a tile to shoot at:
  - Continues to generate random coordinates until a valid tile is hit.
- **Turn Management**: Similar to the disabled difficulty, handles turn switching and ship visibility.

### Medium Difficulty

- **Priority Attacks**: If a ship is hit, adjacent tiles are added to a priority attack list.
- **Attack Logic**: The AI prioritizes attacking these tiles first, using random selection only when necessary.
- **Turn Management**: Manages turn switching and ship visibility as before.

### Hard Difficulty

- **Guaranteed Hits**: The AI continues to shoot until it hits a ship, ensuring a hit every turn.
- **Turn Management**: Consistent with previous difficulty levels, ensuring proper turn management and ship visibility.
